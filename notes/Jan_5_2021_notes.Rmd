- In R, it is more efficient to use the `apply()` family of functions than to
use for loops
    - more on `lapply()`, `sapply()` and `vapply()` [here](https://ademos.people.uic.edu/Chapter4.html)
    
- R has several different ways of accessing list and vector data detailed in
[this article](https://rpubs.com/tomhopper/brackets)
    - `[` for subsets,
    - `[[` for extracting items, and
    - `$` for extracting by name.

- The R equivalent of a dictionary in many other languages is a 
[`hash`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/hash/versions/3.0.1/topics/hash)
denoted with curly braces `{}`

- An overview of object-oriented programming in R can be found
[here](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/oo.html)
    - Basic details on `S3` [here](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/S3.html)
    - the [`sloop`](https://rdrr.io/cran/sloop/) package is helpful when
    learning OOP in R

- I've sketched out that the current functionality of the packages can be
encapsulated into 5 main function file, containing the main function and any
helper functions
