Description: This package provides users with the ability to query the
    Human Cell Atlas data repository for single-cell experiment
    data. The `projects()`, `files()`, `samples()` and `bundles()`
    functions retrieve summary information on each of these indexes;
    corresponding `*_details()` are available for individual entries
    of each index. File-based resources can be downloaded using
    `files_download()`. Advanced use of the package allows the user to
    page through large result sets, and to flexibly query the
    'list-of-lists' structure representing query responses.
